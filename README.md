# AppWeave-FullStack-Intern-Assessment

Problems Faced and Navigations:
1. Dynamic rendering of list of products on search and queries and filters. Implemented 'rederedProducts' array to dynamically update DOM.
2. State Management in Cart. the concept of localStorage implemenation made that task managed.
3. Responsive Layout Issues. Learnt about Bootstrap and was able to implement it.
4. In Reusing the components. Flowchart made the requirements clear to achieve the desired results.
5. I was not *very* proficient with CSS and thus faced problems in cards coloring thus I tried to keep a minimalistic design instead of coloring every button/card.

1. Adding Out Of Stock Button in the string itself without modifying the logic
2. Also updated the products to the products.json instead the main and cart JS files
